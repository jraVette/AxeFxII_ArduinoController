# Installation:
Need to also install Adafruit LED Backpack Libaries and MIDI
(By install, I downloaded the zips from git hub and put them in ~/Documents/Arduino/libraries)
* https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_LED_Backpack
* https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-GFX-Library
* https://github.com/FortySevenEffects/arduino_midi_library/ (I installed 4.3.1)

Note: When compiling need to have the correct board "Arduino/Genuino Mega or Mega 2560"!!
