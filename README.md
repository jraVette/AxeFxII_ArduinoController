Need to also install Adafruit LED Backpack Libaries:
(By install, I downloaded the zips from git hub and put them in ~/Documents/Arduino/libraries)
https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_LED_Backpack
https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-GFX-Library
https://github.com/FortySevenEffects/arduino_midi_library/ (I installed 4.3.1)

When compiling need to have the correct board "Arduino/Genuino Mega or Mega 2560"!!
